= Minimum requirements

== On premise deployment (estimated)

- All hardware (server, readers) on one subnet, broadcasts allowed, static IP
  addresses provided via DHCP.
- Subnet should be isolated for security as reader payloads are not
  authenticated.
- Total bandwidth between readers and server at least 1 Mbps per reader in both
  directions at all times.
- Server port 443 accessible to all operators.
- Remote SSH access to server for maintenance.
- Minimum server spec: dual-core Xeon, i7 or equivalent AMD CPU with 8 MB cache,
  32 GB RAM, 1 TB disk (but varies with use case)

== Cloud deployment

- On-prem agent minimum spec: 50 GB disk, 8 GB RAM
- TBD
