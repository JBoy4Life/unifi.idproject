= Gallagher Detection Logger

Reads UHF-TID detections from unifi-core via its RabbitMQ exchange and sends
them to an instance of Gallagher Command Centre via its DCOM-based FTCAPI.

Tested with Gallagher Command Centre 7.50.

For configuration options see the
link:src/main/java/id/unifi/service/integration/gallagher/Config.java[Config interface].

== Build dependencies

- Oracle JDK 10
- Maven 3.5+
- unifi-common Java library
- RabbitMQ (runtime only)

== Running

A RabbitMQ exchange for detection matches must be created first.
The easiest way to do that is to run unifi-core at least once.

    mvn clean install
    mvn exec:java

== Cleanup

The process will bind a durable RabbitMQ queue to an exchange.
This queue should be removed if this project isn't being used to prevent it from
filling up:

    rabbitmqadmin delete queue name=integration.gallagher.logger
